# Hardware-Descriptive-Language-Projects
projects where Verilog is used 

**HDL Project 1**:

Your task is to design, simulate and test in hardware (on the Digilent Basys 3 FPGA 
prototyping  board)  a  “Device”  which  displays  variable  color  patterns  on  a  string  of  five  (5) 
WS2812B GRB LEDs in the following manner. The possible score range shown below for your 
project is associated with the difficulty of the requirements that your design meets. 

the purpose is to gain familiarity  with  using  Verilog  and  Xilinx  Vivado  to  implement  a  timing-critical 
serial communications project using the Digilent Basys 3 FPGA board. 


**HDL project 2**:

_The Purpose_: Gain familiarity with basic computer architecture and how it can be implemented using 
Verilog.  Use  the  ARMv4  processor  as  an  example  computer  architecture  and  demonstrate  the 
ability to adapt a moderately large hierarchal Verilog implementation of the ARM to include more 
instructions, using the Digilent Basys 3 FPGA board.
